# My VSCode experience with Git conflicts

## By Ceasar Salas on March 7, 2021


### My narrative
I will briefly write about what happened before analyzing it according to what we have learned in class. 

VSC Welcome Screen             |  VSC Source Control

I had heard good things about Visual Studio Code(VSCode) from various other students and professors, which led me to try it. 
However, I was not aware of the built-in source control that is almost constantly active. 
The initial download state of VSCode had then become the default run state that it started in. Every time I started VSCode effectively dumped all of my previously written work into being a clean slate, to
like when VSCode was first downloaded. At this point, I kept trying despite wanting to give up. I attempted to change the settings of VSCode; however, the initial blank settings page kept getting restored regardless of what I did. 
The problem was something to do with Git conflicting with saving the files. I was not very good with Git at the time. I still have challenges using Git and source control. By the time I realized a possible solution, VSCode would keep restoring to some point in time when I did not have my Github data added to the settings. After much frustration, I ended up switching to regular Visual Studio and uninstalling it. This was after having done like 4 to 5 hours trying 
to make the program work to no avail, about 3 of said hours being actual work on an assignment I wrote.

### My Analysis
Clearly, from the story I provided above, the **usability** is about as low as VSCode can get: it destroyed what work
was done. The **learnability** is questionable, as the meaning of the word can depend on its interpretation of the word. For me the 
**learnability** was incredibly low since, despite the program being easy to use, VSCode made it incredibly hard to do any work.
VSCode is very **efficient** and **effective** since it 
color-codes and smart-types programming terms. The two sibling programs of VSCode and VS are great for programming as programmers are likely
their *primary consumer target*. I believe VSCode is fully optimized to use Git, and I did not need that kind of
work environment. My errors may have been *user error* or the problem was that I was influenced to use the wrong product to meet my goals. If it was a
*user error* by me, then the error may be a usability fault by not informing the requirement of source contol. 
Since I have mentioned *user error*, the concept of **error tolerance** can also be brought into consideration. 
In this case, I had somehow set the source control to be by a hard drive which caused VSCode to preserve its state even if I tried to delete things. A simple error solution for this would be a 'nuke it' button which would immediately disconnect the source control linkage.

###### Strengths
VSCode has a lot of strengths. As mentioned, it **affords** highly-optimized text editing for programmers. 
It being *hackable*, that is ability significant personal customization, and the ability to downloaded *packages*, 
free features, and extensions make VSCode a great tool. For those that not like VSCode, there is its sibling program VS that users can switch to while not switching to a competitor's product. VSCode also **affords** Github integration as it is present on the GUI. 
***
###### Weaknesses
VSCode's Github integration is also a weakness though since those who do not use Github will kill their **user
experience**. Ruining any amount of satisfaction they could have had out of the tool, possibly turning them into a 
competitor product. As I mentioned, my personal experience caused the worst possible **usability** which was the deletion of completed work. If that is not a *weakness* for being a *potential threat* to any user, I am not sure what is. 



###### Other Comments
I wasn't sure what the minimum requirement for writing was, so I hope this is enough.
